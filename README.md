## Solidity Storage, Memory and Calldata

Exploring how storage, memory and calldata work in Solidity

The src folder contains three files `Storage.sol`, `Memory.sol` and `Calldata.sol`

Each file contains contracts demonstrating how storage and memory work.

The test folder contains three files `Storage.t.sol`, `Memory.t.sol` and `Calldata.sol`

Each file has tests that can be run to see how storage and memory work.

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```
