## Solidity Storage and Memory

Exploring how storage and memory work in Solidity

The src folder contains two files `Storage.sol` and `Memory.sol`

Each file contains contracts demonstrating how storage and memory work.

The test folder contains two files `Storage.t.sol` and `Memory.t.sol`

Each file has tests that can be run to see how storage and memory work.

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```
